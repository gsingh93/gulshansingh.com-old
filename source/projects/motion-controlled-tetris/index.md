### Description

In my first semester at the University of Michigan, I was lucky enough to get into the Engineering 100 class of my choice: Microprocessors and Toys. I was even luckier when I got placed with my amazing group members: Peter Romanelli, Patrick Hays, and Jay Soni. Throughout the semester, we used Verilog, a hardware description language to create an assembly language (fittingly called the E100 assembly language) which we used to create some type of toy or game. Our project was motion controlled Tetris. Our game is intended to run on an Altera DE2 board, but I've provided the E100 simulator (called ASE100) to simulate the board.

Here's a video of Patrick playing the final product (unfortunately, there's no sound)

### How To Run

You can download the source code from our github repository; I'll post more instructions on running it soon.
