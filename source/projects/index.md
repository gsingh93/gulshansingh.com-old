Projects
========
<br>

These are only some of the projects I've done, as a lot of the code I've written is scattered across a number of computers/Linux distros. There is also a lot of code I've written that wouldn't qualify as a releasable "project", but more of a proof of concept to learn how different technologies/frameworks work. I'll try to post about these on my blog.

#### [Motion Controlled Tetris](/projects/motion-controlled-tetris/)

A motion controlled Tetris game made to run on an FPGA board. Written using the ASE100 assembly instruction set.
<br>

#### [Gulbuntu OS](/projects/gulbuntu/)

An OS I wrote in high school. Doesn't have a file system or thread library, just boots into a terminal with two commands.
<br>

#### [Compiler](/projects/compiler/)

A compiler I wrote in high school for a simple C-like language. Written in Python. I later found out in college that this was an LL(1) language.
<br>

#### [Learn Kirtan](/projects/learn-kirtan/)

An opensource program to teach kirtan. Allows you to type shabad notes and words and have the keys be played back on the screen. Also allows the user to play the keys using the mouse or the keyboard.
<br>

#### [Lens Simulation](/projects/lens-simulation/)

A application I wrote in high school (during physics class) to simulate simple lens refraction.
<br>

#### [English and Punjabi Wordsearch Generator](/projects/wordsearch-generator)

Generate wordsearch puzzles in both English and Punjabi
<br>

#### [MLecture Download](/projects/mlecture-download)

The class lecture site doesn't provide a way to download the videos. Through some reverse engineering, I've created this site to allow you to download these videos.
<br>

#### [Sikh History Questions](/projects/sikh-history-questions)

A website for learning Sikh History.
<br>

#### [Sublime Text TopCoder Helper](/projects/topcoder-helper)

A plugin to parse TopCoder problem statements and generate boilerplate code.
<br>

#### [Google Chrome Regex Search](/projects/regex-search)

A Google Chrome extension to search a page using regex.
<br>

#### [Google Chrome Page and Extension Refresh](/projects/page-and-extension-refresh)

A Google Chrome extension that makes developing Chrome extensions easier. Select which extensions and which URLs should be reloaded, and click the button to reload your selections.
<br>

#### [FaceBash](/projects/facebash)

A Google Chrome extension that started at the Yahoo 2013 Intern Hackathon. It turns every input box in your Facebook page into a Bash terminal.
<br>

#### [Hacker Live Wallpaper](/projects/hacker-live-wallpaper)

A customizable Android live wallpaper that displays a Matrix-style animation of falling zeros and ones.
<br>

#### [Simple Key Logger](/projects/simple-key-logger)

A keylogger I wrote in C for Linux. Logkeys stopped working in Ubuntu 13.04, and the code for it was horribly written, so I decided to write my own, cleaner keylogger.
<br>

#### [CC Snake](/projects/cc-snake)

My team's hack for the MHacks 2012. It's a multi-screen, networked, snake game, so when the snake goes of one player's screen, it seamlessly continues on the other player's computer screen.
<br>

#### [WHISPER, MANES, and Shout](/projects/whisper-manes-shout)

A research project that I worked on for two years regarding censorship resistant mobile ad hoc networks, resulting in an Android app that uses an emulated ad hoc network (soon to be moved to a real ad hoc network).
