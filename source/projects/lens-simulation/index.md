### Description

This is another project I made back in high school. In physics, we learned about [simple lenses](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/refrn/u14l5a.cfm), and one day during class I got bored and decided to make this. The program allows the user to move an object and see how the light rays are refracted through a converging lens. The focal points, image heights, image distance, and more are all calculated and displayed on the screen.

### How To Run

To run the software, [download the source](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?rnwnq4ga659nn6r), extract the contents, and navigate to the dist folder. Double click the LensSimulation.jar file. If you have Java installed, the application should load up. If you have any problems running the software or if you've found this software helpful as a teacher or student, let me know in the comments!

### How To Build

When I wrote this software I was new to Java and software design, so I'm letting you know right now that the code isn't that great. Luckily, it's fairly short, so if you want to understand it or improve it, it shouldn't be too difficult. Another issue is that, as a newbie, I used Netbeans's GUI builder, making the code even worse and coupling it to Netbeans (believe me when I say I'll never use a GUI builder again).

To build the source, simply [download the source](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?rnwnq4ga659nn6r), extract the contents, and open the project with [Netbeans](http://netbeans.org/) by going to File > Open Project and navigating to the folder you extracted the source to. Then run the project by going to Run > Run Project.
