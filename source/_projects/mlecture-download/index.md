At the University of Michigan, some professors will post recordings of their lectures. This is useful, because it allows us to review any content we might not completely understand before the exam. The issue is that there is no way to speed up the lecture recording, so watching multiple lectures will take a lot of time, as a typical lecture is an hour and a half.

I realized one day that if the video player new where to find the video, than it was likely I could find the original video file just by looking through the page source.
