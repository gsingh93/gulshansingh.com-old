### Description

At MHacks 2013 (a 36 hour hackathon at U of M), me and two other people came up with the idea for a Cross Computer Snake game, or CC Snake. There were two main goals we had for this game that would differentiate it from other snake games. The first was that the snake game wouldn't be played on a window, but directly on the screen, on top of other windows, and it would stay on top of other windows even when it lost focus. Our second goal, was to have the snake move seamlessly from one computer to the next computer when it got to the edge of the screen. Obviously, these were two big goals to tackle. There was a lot of design decisions to make, and a lot of clever hacks were implemented. I'll document all of these things later, but for now, here is the source code to look through, and a video of the game in action.
