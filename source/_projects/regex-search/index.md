During the [2013 College Puzzle Challenge](https://www.collegepuzzlechallenge.com/) (where my team got 2nd at our school and 34th overall), I really needed an extension that would allow me to search webpages using regex. Some puzzles would reveal parts of words that might be found on a Wikipedia page, but there's no way to search for, for example, words that have 'a' as their third letter. The extensions already in the Chrome store didn't work, and I'd always wanted to learn how to write a Chrome extension, so I set out to write one.

To be honest with you, Chrome extension development is a pain in the ass. The documentation isn't good, it's hard to debug, and there aren't many good examples. I originally gave up on the project, but after learning a bit more JavaScript and finding some useful examples on StackOverflow, I finally got it working.

You can find the source on [Github](https://github.com/gsingh93/regex-search) or download it from the [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/regex-search/bcdabfmndggphffkchfdcekcokmbnkjl).
