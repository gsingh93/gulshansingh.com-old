After working on my [Regex Search](/projects/regex-search) and [FaceBash](/projects/facebash) Chrome extensions, I was fed up with the annoying process of reloading the extension and then reloading the pages you're testing on every time you made a change to the extension. To make this process easier, I made this extension. It allows you to input the URLs of the pages you're testing on as well as select all the extensions you want to refresh. Then when you click on extension icon, it refreshes all of the specified URLs and extensions. Now it only takes one click to reload an extension, instead of multiple clicks and tab switches.

You can see the source on [github](https://github.com/gsingh93/page-extension-refresh) or download it on the [Chrome store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/page-and-extension-refres/ichaahgapgcnefhnlmpljbjeddohppph).
