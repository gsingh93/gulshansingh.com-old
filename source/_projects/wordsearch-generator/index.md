A few years ago, when I was looking for a replacement for JavaScript, I stumbled upon a programming language called [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/). Dart has a much better type system than JavaScript, a sane way of interacting with the DOM, and some cool language features. In order to learn the language better, I thought of building a wordsearch generator in Dart. Since my parents teach Punjabi, I thought it also might be useful if the generator also supported Punjabi. You can find my finished result [here](http://gulshansingh.com/wordsearch/) and the source code [here](https://github.com/gsingh93/punjabi-wordsearch).

I had originally done a similar project to learn HTML5/Canvas, and that's the project out of which my hate for JavaScript began. After doing the same project in Dart, I can say that enjoyed using Dart much more than JavaScript, and there were a lot fewer times when I was angry at the language or the type system for screwing me over. Since I finished this project, I've also used [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/), and I've found these to also be fairly good replacements for JavaScript (and in the case of Elm, for HTML and CSS as well).
