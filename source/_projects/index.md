Projects
========
You can find a complete list of my projects on [Github](https://github.com/gsingh93) (other than a few interesting projects that got lost before Github existed), but since there are a lot, here are a few projects that I've bothered to write about.

#### [Motion Controlled Tetris](/projects/motion-controlled-tetris/)

A motion controlled Tetris game made to run on an FPGA board. Written using the ASE100 assembly instruction set.

#### [Gulbuntu OS](/projects/gulbuntu/)

An operating system I wrote in high school. Doesn't have a file system or thread library, just boots into a terminal with two commands.

#### [Compiler](/projects/compiler/)

A compiler I wrote in high school for a simple C-like language. Written in Python. I didn't know it at the time, but I was actually writing an LL(1) language using recursive descent.

#### [Learn Kirtan](/projects/learn-kirtan/)

An open source program to teach kirtan. Allows you to type shabad notes and words and have the keys be played back on the screen. Also allows the user to play the keys using the mouse or the keyboard.

#### [Lens Simulation](/projects/lens-simulation/)

A application I wrote in high school (during physics class) to simulate simple lens refraction.

#### [English and Punjabi Wordsearch Generator](/projects/wordsearch-generator/)

Generate wordsearch puzzles in both English and Punjabi

#### [Sikh History Questions Quiz Site](/projects/sikh-history-questions/)

A website for learning Sikh History.

#### [FaceBash](/projects/facebash/)

A Google Chrome extension that started at the Yahoo 2013 Intern Hackathon. It turns every input box in your Facebook page into a Bash terminal.

#### [Hacker Live Wallpaper](/projects/hacker-live-wallpaper/)

A customizable Android live wallpaper that displays a Matrix-style animation of falling zeros and ones.

#### [CC Snake](/projects/cc-snake/)

My team's hack for the MHacks 2013. It's a multi-screen, networked, snake game, so when the snake goes of one player's screen, it seamlessly continues on the other player's computer screen.
