Projects
========
<br>

You can find a complete list of my projects on [Github](https://github.com/gsingh93) (other than a few interesting projects that got lost before Github existed), but since there are a lot, here are a few projects of interest.

<br>

#### [Motion Controlled Tetris](/projects/motion-controlled-tetris/)

A motion controlled Tetris game made to run on an FPGA board. Written using the ASE100 assembly instruction set.

<br>

#### [Gulbuntu OS](/projects/gulbuntu/)

An operating system I wrote in high school. Doesn't have a file system or thread library, just boots into a terminal with two commands.

<br>

#### [Compiler](/projects/compiler/)

A compiler I wrote in high school for a simple C-like language. Written in Python. I didn't know it at the time, but I was actually writing an LL(1) language using recursive descent.

<br>

#### [Learn Kirtan](/projects/learn-kirtan/)

An open source program to teach kirtan. Allows you to type shabad notes and words and have the keys be played back on the screen. Also allows the user to play the keys using the mouse or the keyboard.

<br>

#### [Lens Simulation](/projects/lens-simulation/)

A application I wrote in high school (during physics class) to simulate simple lens refraction.

<br>

#### [English and Punjabi Wordsearch Generator](/projects/wordsearch-generator/)

Generate wordsearch puzzles in both English and Punjabi

<br>

#### [MLecture Download](/projects/mlecture-download/)

The lecture recording site at the University of Michigan previously didn't let you download the lecture videos, which is very useful for watching lectures at a faster speed or offline. I love trying to figure out how these sites work (after all, the site must be getting the video from somewhere, so why can't we?), so I did some digging and figured out how it works. I created this site to make the downloading process easy, and while the site has been updated and this is no longer need, I thought it was still cool enough to post about.

<br>

#### [Sikh History Questions Quiz Site](/projects/sikh-history-questions/)

A website for learning Sikh History.

<br>

#### [Google Chrome Regex Search](/projects/regex-search/)

A Google Chrome extension to search a page using regex.

<br>

#### [Google Chrome Page and Extension Refresh](/projects/page-and-extension-refresh/)

A Google Chrome extension that makes developing Chrome extensions easier. Select which extensions and which URLs should be reloaded, and click the button to reload your selections.

<br>

#### [FaceBash](/projects/facebash/)

A Google Chrome extension that started at the Yahoo 2013 Intern Hackathon. It turns every input box in your Facebook page into a Bash terminal.

<br>

#### [Hacker Live Wallpaper](/projects/hacker-live-wallpaper/)

A customizable Android live wallpaper that displays a Matrix-style animation of falling zeros and ones.

<br>

#### [Simple Key Logger](/projects/simple-key-logger/)

A keylogger I wrote in C for Linux. Logkeys stopped working in Ubuntu 13.04, and the code for it was horribly written, so I decided to write my own, cleaner keylogger.

<br>

#### [CC Snake](/projects/cc-snake/)

My team's hack for the MHacks 2013. It's a multi-screen, networked, snake game, so when the snake goes of one player's screen, it seamlessly continues on the other player's computer screen.
