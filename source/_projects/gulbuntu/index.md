In high school, one of the things I was most curious about was operating systems. After a lot of reading, I realized the only way I would truly understand them was by writing one. I spent months learning C, x86 assembly, and OS fundamentals. After about a month of failure, I finally was able to boot my OS in Qemu. The OS didn't have a thread library or a filesystem, but it was able to boot and run simple commands like `help` and `cls` to clear the screen. Now that I have enough knowledge and experience to write a full fledged OS, I plan on implementing one and creating a tutorial on how to do it. For those of you who can't wait for this tutorial, you can find a lot of good information at [OSDev](http://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page).

You can find instructions for building and running the OS on it's Github page: https://github.com/gsingh93/gulbuntu
